The Animated Chainsaw lusts for blood.
	Once in downtown Chicago the chainsaw met a man named Dan. Dan cried out in fear of the chainsaw. Dan didn't know what to think of this 
life like chainsaw. He wondered what was keeping the chainsaw running, something had to be completing the circuit of the magnetic relay that kept it going.
Meanwhile the chainsaw reved, It was envious of Dan, his abiltiy to analyze cirucits, his ability to walk and communicate. The chainsaw struck quickly
slicing dan and taking his legs and brain. The formally Animated Chainsaw had evolved into a humanoid chainsaw that can analyze linear circuits with 
overly long winded exlplanations. The chainsaw moved on...
