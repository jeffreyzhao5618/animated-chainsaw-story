	On a hot summer in a moldy underground lab, a mad scientist's experiment results in a potion that gives life to inanimate objects.
The scientist tests this potion on a chainsaw creating Animated Chainsaw. In hindsight this was a bad idea because the chainsaw come to life
and cuts the scientists head off. The chainsaw then cuts through the metal lab door and burst out into the streets of downtown Chicago. 
The Animated Chainsaw lusts for blood.
